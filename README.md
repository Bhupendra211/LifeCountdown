# Life Countdown Timer ⏳

A responsive web application that calculates and displays the remaining time of your life, assuming an average lifespan of 67.74 years (according to 2022 data). The timer dynamically updates every second, showing the remaining years, months, days, hours, minutes, and seconds in real-time.

## 📋 How It Works

1. The default **date of birth** (DOB) is **02-11-2000**.
2. The app calculates the elapsed time since your birth.
3. It subtracts this from a customizable lifespan (default: 67.74 years).
4. Displays the remaining time in a dynamic countdown format:
   - **Years**
   - **Months**
   - **Days**
   - **Hours**
   - **Minutes**
   - **Seconds**

## 📱 Responsive Design

The layout dynamically adjusts to different screen sizes:
- **Desktop**: Full multi-column layout.
- **Tablet**: Adjusts to fewer columns.
- **Mobile**: Single-column layout for optimal viewing.
